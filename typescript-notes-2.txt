**How to create ts project**
1 - create the ts fileusing (.ts) extension
2 - generate the typescript config file using [ tsc --init ]
2 - run the code [ tsc fileName.ts ] for each time OR use [ tsc --watch ] for automatically compile


**Basic Types**
=> Each data has its types.
- Primitive types
- Arrays
- Tuples
- Enums
- Any, Unknown, Void, Null, Undefined, Never


*Primitive & refrence
Primitive - string, number, boolean etc

refrence - [] {} ()

Example :
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
let newArr = arr
newArr.pop()
console.log(arr)
console.log(newArr)

note: difference between them is in Primitive we can copy the variable directly but not in refrence like in () {} [] we are not copying the value we are giving the refrence just like in the example we saw that when we are changing the newArr it is reflecting on arr.
