*1. typescript is an advance version of javascript*
TS default behavior: we can write the js code no matter it is not good according to typescript but it will convert it to javascript like using var we can redeclar a variable, this is not good according to typescript but it will run the code.

javascript made in 10 days thats why there is some problems:

- redeclaration the same variable
var a = 10
var a = 12
this will show error in another language
2nd example: 
this is also works in js
var a = 10
a = 'owais'

etc..

In typescript it is providing a layer in js like its advance version where these types of things is not working and TS also provides more features.


*2. data types*

1. premitive
2. non-premitive

3. refrence - [](){}
note: every three bracets are refrence that effects on parent 
example: 
  let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
  let b = a;
  b.pop() // this will effect on variable (a) too.
  console.log(a, b)
